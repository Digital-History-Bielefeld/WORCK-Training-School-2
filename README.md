## Introduction
This is a workshop on the topic of **"Learning to program as a historian"**. Various basics will be taught in 8 learning units, including:

- Dealing with GitHub (you're in the middle of it right now, congratulations!) and GitHub Codespaces
- Python3 basics
- NLP
- Data analysis for historians


## Why programming for historians?
- **Automation**: Many tasks in the humanities are repetitive and can be automated. This saves time and allows you to focus on the essentials.
- **Data analysis**: The amount of data in the humanities is constantly increasing. With programming, you can analyze and visualize this data.
- **Text analysis**: With programming, you can analyze texts in a way that would be impossible by hand.
- **Web scraping**: With programming, you can extract data from websites and use it for your own purposes.
- **Visualization**: With programming, you can visualize data in a way that would be impossible by hand.


## Workshop structure

The aim of the workshop is to provide as much in-depth knowledge as possible that can also be followed up at home and, above all, to bring the advantages of programming for humanities tasks closer. We will mainly work with Python, as this language is suitable for various reasons: it is very well known, so that information can be obtained quickly; its syntax is easy to understand and understandable, as it is relatively close to natural language; and above all, Python is one of the most important languages for applications that could be of interest to historians, for example dealing with texts, data analysis, web-scraping and much more.

The workshop is structured as follows: There is a folder for each of the following learning units, which contains the content of the panel and is designed to be as interactive as possible. This content is then worked on together and deepened with short inputs. As you are currently in the middle of the first learning unit, let's get started right away!

## How to start

To start, all participants must set up a codespace. We will be working with codespaces throughout the workshop, so here is some information about them.

Follow the instructions below to open your codespace and dive into a hassle-free and efficient development experience. Enjoy the workshop!

1. Click on the code button at the top right
2. There you have two tabs: "Local" and "Codespaces". Click on "Codespaces"
3. Click on the Plus-Button to create a new codespace
4. A new window opens in which you can see a Visual Studio Code environment. This is your codespace. You can now start working on the content of the first learning unit in folder "panel-1".



### Further readings:
- Installing Python
    - https://www.python.org/
    - You can install a Windows Subsystem for Linux on your Windows computer. This allows you to use a fully functional Linux system (including terminal) under Windows - and much more interactively than with a virtual machine.
