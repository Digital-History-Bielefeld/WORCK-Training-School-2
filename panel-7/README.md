# Panel 7: Visualising Results

In this panel, you will learn how to visualise your results using several tools. We will apply these tools in three separate notebooks:
* Visualising with displaCy
* Visualising n-grams
* Visualising word frequencies with matplotlib

Everything you need to follow along is explained step-by-step in the individual notebooks.

For additional information on the individual topics, you can consult the following sources after the tutorial:
