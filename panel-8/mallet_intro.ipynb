    "# Using MALLET for Topic Modelling: An Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "MALLET (Machine Learning for Language Toolkit) is a Java-based toolkit for natural language processing, including document classification, clustering and topic modeling. It is a pure commandline tool, so it does not offer a graphical user interface (GUI) but has to be run from your terminal.\n",

    "In this tutorial, you will learn when and how to use MALLET for topic modelling."

    "## Why use MALLET for topic modelling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you are interested in finding out which topics are covered in a larger corpus of texts. Reading all of it to extract the most relevant topics would take ages. It would also confront you with another question which might be difficult to answer before you have at least scanned the material: How many topics should you extract?\n",
    "If you are working with a small number of files (or even a single document), you could of course perform a word-frequency analysis on the document and try to gauge the most important topics simply by looking at the results. But this approach will become less feasible for large corpora. This is where MALLET comes in: It assigns the words in a text to the most likely topics.\n",

    "**Step 1: Installing MALLET**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since MALLET is a commandline tool, we have to open a terminal in our codespace to install and run the application. In your VS Code editor, open a terminal and type `cd panel-8` to navigate to the `panel-8` folder, then type `ls` to display its contents. You will see that it contains a shell script called `setup_mallet.sh` containing all the commands needed to install mallet in your codespace. Let's execute the script! In your terminal, type `./setup_mallet.sh` to run the script. Congrats - you have now installed MALLET :)"
