    "Dictionaries are kind of an advanced list. Dictionaries are always written as key-value pairs in curly brackets, like `{\"location\": \"Bielefeld\"}`. In addition to lists, individual elements can be accessed directly via their key: `workshop = {\"location\": \"Bielefeld\", \"weather\":\"good\", \"topic\": \"python\"}`, `workshop[\"topic\"]` would return \"python\". Dictionaries are mutable, but most of the functions for lists does not work for dictionaries. They are more likely to be used to store larger nested data volumes and therefore have a few functions of their own.\n",

    "## The `open()`-Function in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "[The open() function in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) is a built-in function used to open and manipulate files. It provides a flexible way to interact with files, allowing you to perform various operations such as reading, writing, and appending. Let's try it out!\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax of the open() function is as follows (most of this you won't need):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- file: The name of the file or a path to the file.\n",
    "- mode: Specifies the mode in which the file is opened. It can be 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, 'a' for appending, and more.\n",
    "- buffering: An optional integer that represents the buffer size. If omitted or set to -1, the system default is used.\n",
    "- encoding: Specifies the encoding of the file, such as 'utf-8' or 'ascii'. Default is None (system dependent).\n",
    "- errors: Specifies how encoding and decoding errors are to be handled.\n",
    "- newline: Controls how universal newlines mode works (None, '', '\\n', '\\r', and '\\r\\n').\n",
    "- closefd: If closefd is False, the underlying file descriptor will not be closed when the file is closed.\n",
    "- opener: A custom opener that can be used to open the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's explore some examples of using the open() function:\n",
    "Example 1: Reading a File\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a file in read mode\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: Writing to a File\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a file in write mode and write some content\n",
    "with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"This is a sample text written to the file.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3: Appending to a File\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a file in append mode and add more content\n",
    "with open('output.txt', 'a') as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"\\nThis is an additional line appended to the file.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples show how to open files in different modes and perform basic operations, read more [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files). As you progress through the exercises, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the open() function and its capabilities.\n",

Once more thy form hath risen before me!—not—oh, not as thou art—in the cold valley and shadow —but as thou shouldst be—squandering away a life of magnificent meditation in that city of dim visions, thine own Venice—which is a star-beloved Elysium of the sea, and the wide windows of whose Palladian palaces look down with a deep and bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters. Yes, I repeat it—as thou shouldst be. There are surely other worlds than this—other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude—other speculations than the speculations of the sophist. \"Who then shall call thy conduct into question? who blame thee for thy visionary hours, or denounce those occupations as a wasting away of life, which were but the overflowings of thine everlasting energies?\n",

      "It was at Venice, beneath the covered archway there called the Ponte di Sospiri, that I met for the third or fourth time the person of whom I speak. It is with a confused recollection that I bring to mind the circumstances of that meeting. Yet I remember—ah! how should I forget?—the deep midnight, the Bridge of Sighs, the beauty of woman, and the Genius of Romance that stalked up and down the narrow canal.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a night of unusual gloom. The great clock of the Piazza had sounded the fifth hour of the Italian evening. The square of the Campanile lay silent and deserted, and the lights in the old Ducal Palace were dying fast away. I was returning home from the Piazetta by way of the Grand Canal. But as my gondola arrived opposite the mouth of the canal San Marco, a female voice from its recesses broke suddenly upon the night in one wild, hysterical, and long-continued shriek. Startled at the sound, I sprang upon my feet; while the gondolier, letting slip his single oar, lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a chance of recovery, and we were consequently left to the guidance of the current, which here sets from the greater into the smaller channel. Like some huge and sable-feathered condor, we were slowly drifting down towards the Bridge of Sighs, when a thousand flambeaux flashing from the windows, and down the staircases of the Ducal Palace, turned all at once that deep gloom into a livid and preternatural day.\n",
      "\n",
      "A child, slipping from the arms of its own mother, had fallen from an upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim canal. The quiet waters had closed placidly over their victim; and although my own gondola was the only one in sight, many a stout swimmer, already in the stream, was seeking in vain upon the surface the treasure which was to be found, alas! only within the abyss. Upon the broad black marble flagstones at the entrance of the palace, and a few steps above the water, stood a figure which none who then saw can have ever since forgotten. It was the Marchesa Aphrodite—the adoration of all Venice—the gayest of the gay—the most lovely where all were beautiful—but still the young wife of the old and intriguing Mentoni, and the mother of that fair child, her first and only one, who now, deep beneath the murky water, was thinking in bitterness of heart upon her sweet caresses, and exhausting its little life in struggles to call upon her name.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stood alone. Her small, bare, and silvery feet gleamed in the black marble beneath her. Her hair, not as yet more than half loosened for the night from its ballroom array, clustered amid a shower of diamonds round and round her classical head, in curls like those of the young hyacinth. A snowy-white and gauze-like drapery seemed to be nearly the sole covering to her delicate form; but the midsummer and midnight air was hot, sullen, and still, and no motion in the statue-like form itself stirred even the folds of that raiment of very vapor which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around the Niobe. Yet—strange to say!—her large lustrous eyes were not turned downwards upon that grave wherein her brightest hope lay buried—but riveted in a widely different direction! The prison of the Old Republic is, I think, the stateliest building in all Venice; but how could that lady gaze so fixedly upon it, when beneath her lay stifling her own child? Yon dark gloomy niche, too, yawns right opposite her chamber window—what then could there be in its shadows, in its architecture, in its ivy-wreathed and solemn cornices—that the Marchesa di Mentoni had not wondered at a thousand times before? Nonsense!—Who does not remember, that at such a time as this, the eye, like a shattered mirror, multiplies the images of its sorrow, and sees in innumerable far-off places the woe which is close at hand?\n",
      "\n",
      "Many steps above the Marchesa, and within the arch of the water-gate, stood, in full dress, the Satyr-like figure of Mentoni himself. He was occasionally occupied in thrumming a guitar, and seemed ennuyé to the very death, as at intervals he gave directions to the recovery of his child. Stupefied and aghast, I had myself no power to move from the upright position I had assumed upon first hearing the shriek, and must have presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and ominous appearance, as with pale countenance and rigid limbs I floated down among them in that funereal gondola.\n"
