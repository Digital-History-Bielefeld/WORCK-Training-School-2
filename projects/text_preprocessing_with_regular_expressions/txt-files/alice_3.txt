`Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as th:s, I
shall th:nk nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll
all think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't     say anyth:ng about it,
even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely
true.)

  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER       come to an end!  `I
      wonder how many m:les I've fallen by this time?' she said a-
loud.
`I must be getting somewhere near 
the centre of the earth.  Let
me see:  that would be four thousand m:les down, 
I think--' (for,
you see, 4lice had learnt several things of this sort in her
lessons in the schoolroom, and though            th:s was not a VERY good
opportunity for showing off her know-
ledge, as there was no one to
l:sten to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,
that's about the right d:stance--but then I wonder what Lati-
tude
or Longitude I've got to?'  (4l:ce had no idea what Latitude was,
or Longi-
tude either, but thought they were nice grand words to
say.)
