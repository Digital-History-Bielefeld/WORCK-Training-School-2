4l:ce was beg:nning to get very tired of sitting by her sis-
ter
on the bank, and of having nothing to do :  once or tw:ce she had
peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
pictures or con-
versations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'
thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'

  So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,
for the hot day made her          
feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
the pleasure of making a daisy-chain 

would be worth the trouble
of getting up and picking the da:sies, when suddenly a White
Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

  There was nothing so VERY remark-
able in that; nor d:d 4lice
think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!     I shall be late!'  (when she thought
it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have
wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed qu:te natural);
but when the Rabb:t actually TOOK   A W4TCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCO4T-
POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to
her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never
before seen a rabb:t with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to
take out of it, and burn-
ing with curiosity, she ran across the
field after it, and fortunate-
ly was just in time to see it pop
down a large        rabb:t-hole under the hedge.
